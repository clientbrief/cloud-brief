# Client Brief – Brief Standard

This document defines the quality and structure standard for all briefs published under Client Brief.

---

## Core Principles

Every brief must:

1. Be fictional but realistic  
2. Reflect real-world constraints  
3. Present imperfect information  
4. Require judgment and trade-offs  
5. Avoid idealized or absolute solutions  

---

## Mandatory Sections

Each brief **must include**:

- Client Background  
- Business Context  
- Constraints & Limitations  
- Existing Systems (if any)  
- Technical Requirements  
- Non-Technical Constraints (cost, people, compliance)  
- Known Risks  
- Open Questions / Ambiguities  

---

## Tone & Style

- Professional and enterprise-oriented  
- Neutral, not opinionated  
- No marketing language  
- No certification-style phrasing  
- Written as if addressed to a real engineering team  

---

## What to Avoid

- “Best practice” absolutism  
- Over-optimized greenfield assumptions  
- Unrealistic budgets or timelines  
- Perfect team skill assumptions  

---

## Evaluation Focus

A good brief enables:

- Architecture discussion  
- Trade-off justification  
- Risk identification  
- Decision communication  

Not correctness, but **reasonableness**.
