# Cloud Client Brief  
**Scenario ID:** CB-CLOUD-002  
**Industry:** Manufacturing & Distribution  
**Company Size:** ~420 employees  
**Geography:** Southeast Asia  
**Cloud Maturity:** Low  
**Timeline Sensitivity:** Medium  

---

## 1. Client Background

The client is a long-established manufacturing and distribution company with over 20 years of operational history. Technology has historically played a supporting role rather than a strategic one.

Most systems were introduced incrementally to support accounting, inventory, and reporting needs, resulting in a fragmented technology landscape.

---

## 2. Business Context

The company is facing increasing pressure from competitors who operate with faster fulfillment cycles and better digital visibility.

Management has approved limited modernization efforts, but only if:
- Costs remain tightly controlled
- Business operations are not disrupted
- Existing staff can continue operating the systems

There is no immediate revenue growth target tied to this initiative.

---

## 3. Current State (Existing Systems)

- On-premise virtualized servers nearing end-of-life
- ERP system customized over many years
- File-based data exchange between systems
- Manual backup processes
- No centralized monitoring or alerting

Several systems are business-critical but poorly understood.

---

## 4. Technical Requirements (Known)

- Extend system lifespan without full replacement
- Improve system reliability and backup consistency
- Enable limited remote access for operational teams
- Reduce dependency on aging hardware

---

## 5. Constraints & Limitations

### Financial
- Very limited cloud budget
- Strong preference for predictable monthly spend
- No tolerance for experimental services

### Organizational
- Small IT team focused on maintenance
- No cloud specialists
- High reliance on external vendors historically

### Technical
- Legacy ERP cannot be refactored
- Some workloads are tightly coupled
- Documentation is outdated or missing

---

## 6. Known Risks

- Hidden dependencies within legacy systems
- Cost surprises due to lack of usage visibility
- Vendor dependence increasing rather than decreasing

---

## 7. Open Questions

- Acceptable downtime during migration
- Willingness to operate hybrid environments
- Long-term intention: modernization or stabilization only

---

## Decision Context Summary

The objective is **risk reduction and cost control**, not innovation.

Any decision must prioritize operational continuity over architectural cleanliness.
